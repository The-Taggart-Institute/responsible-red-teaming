## MSF

This section of the course uses the Metasploit Framework. Any current version of MSF will work for this lab. Please follow the instructions detailed in the lab to install the current build of MSF.

## Sliver
This section of the course uses Sliver v1.5.29, which is the latest release at the time of course creation. The lab has been built and tested using this version.

All code can be found at https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases/tag/v1.5.29

In practice, it's likely that any version of Sliver >= 1.5.29 will work for this lab with some miniscule differences, so feel free to use the latest version of Sliver to complete these labs. 

The course only uses the Linux server binary. This file is too large to commit into a GitHub repo and can be found at the course share drive if needed:

The password for the infrastructure_design 7Z folder is `RRTonTTI`

The original source code and license for Sliver are also included in the share. Please review the license before using the Sliver software.

## Merlin

This section of the course uses Merlin v1.5.0 for the main demonstration. It also uses an older version (v0.9.0-beta) for the section on PRISM. Please
