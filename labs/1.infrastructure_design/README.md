Please review the MSF license before using the software.

## Merlin

This section of the course uses Merlin v1.5.0 for the main demonstration. It also uses an older version (v0.9.0-beta) for the section on PRISM. Please follow the lab instructions in this section to download and install Merlin.

[v1.5.0](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/releases/download/v1.5.0/)

[v0.9.0-beta and the PRISM utility](https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/releases/download/v0.9.0-beta/)

Please review the Merlin license before using the software.

## Sliver
This section of the course uses Sliver v1.5.29, which is the latest release at the time of course creation. The lab has been built and tested using this version.

All code can be found at https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases/tag/v1.5.29

In practice, it's likely that any version of Sliver >= 1.5.29 will work for this lab with some miniscule differences, so feel free to use the latest version of Sliver to complete these labs. 

Please review the license before using the Sliver software.
